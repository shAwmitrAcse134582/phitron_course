1.difference between primary key and composite key:
Primary key:When a unique value is used to identify a tuple in a table that is called primary key.
Primary key can't be null and it must be unique.

Composite key:When two or multiple value is used to identify a tuple that is called composite key.
In composite key two or more column is needed

2.Difference between using join query or not using join query:
without join query:Without join query we use conditional statement between two table common column to
build relationship.It is less efficient and more time complexiety.

example:
	SELECT s.student_id, s.name, l.book
    FROM student s, library l
	WHERE s.student_id = l.student_id;
  

using join query:Here we build relationship between two table using join keyword and 
as a condition we use ON keyword.It is more efficient and less time complexiety than  without
join query.

example:
   SELECT s.student_id, s.name, l.book
   FROM student s JOIN library l 
   ON s.student_id = l.student_id;

3.Create employee and department table following those instruction

  CREATE DATABASE University;
  
  CREATE TABLE Department(
  dept_id int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    dept_name varchar(50) NOT NULL
 );
 
 
 CREATE TABLE employee(
  First_Name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  Last_Name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  DOB Date Not NULL,
  Dept_id int,
  FOREIGN key (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id),
  salary int CHECK(salary>0)
  );
  
Insert INTO department(dept_id,dept_name)
VALUES(' ','CSE'),
      (' ','EEE');
	  
INSERT INTO employee(First_Name,Last_Name,Dob,dept_id,salary)
VALUES("Shawmitra","Das",'2002-06-06',1,450000)

4.Write SQL Query to get the second max salary
	SELECT DISTINCT salary
	FROM employees
	ORDER by salary DESC
	LIMIT 1
	OFFSET 1

5.Write SQL Query to show  the department names and the average salary of the departments.
SELECT d.department_name,AVG(salary) AS Avarage_salary
from departments d JOIN employees e
ON d.department_id=e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name

6. Illustrate the INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, SELF Joins
 
 Inner joins:Inner joins is only common element between two tables
   
   
 Left joins:common and left table elements will be the output
 
 
 Right joins:common and write table elements will be the output
 
 
 self joins:A self join in SQL is when a table is joined with itself.
 
 
7.What is a subquery? Write with an example

A subquery is query under a query.It is a nested query within another query.
example:
  select max(salary)
  from employees
  where salary<(
              select max(salary)
			  from employees
              );
8.Show the names of the employees who get less salary than Steven
SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary<(SELECT salary
              FROM employees
              WHERE first_name='Steven'
              LIMIT 1);
	
9.Count the number of employees of each job type
SELECT j.job_title as JOB_TYPE , COUNT(e.employee_id) AS Employee_Number
FROM employees e JOIN jobs j
ON e.job_id = j.job_id
GROUP BY JOB_TYPE ;

10.Show the names of Departments which doesnâ€™t have any employees
SELECT d.department_name
FROM departments d LEFT JOIN employees e
ON d.department_id = e.employee_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL;
