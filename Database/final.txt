UNION and UNION ALL both operators is used to combine the two set result.

Basic difference is IN  UNION operation ,there have no duplicate value in result
,But UNION ALL operation ,there may have duplicate value.

UNION ALL operation  is faster than UNION operation because
it does not perform extra operation to remove duplicate.

Note:The columns selected by each SELECT statement must be of the same
data type and in the same order.

ERD is my most important topic in this course.

ERD stands for Entity-Relationship Diagram. It's a visual representation used
in database design to describe the relationships between different entities in a system.
ERDs are valuable tools for database designers and developers.

I found interesting in ERD because through the ERD I can get an overview in the full database
and can implement the database easily.
