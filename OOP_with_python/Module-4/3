3(a):Difference between List and Dictionary of Python:
1.List can store duplicate element but dictionary only store unique element.
2.It can't construct key value pair but dictionary can construct key value pair.
3.List is used [] bracket to store data but dictionary is used {} bracket to store data
4.List maintains ordered to store data but dictionary don't follow any order to keep data
5.List's index is integer data type but dictionary key can be any kind of data type
6.List itself is a data structure but dictionary follows hashtable or hashmap

3(b):Writing about *args and **kwargs of Python with proper examples in below
*args:*args is used to receive many values as parameter.It is used single asterisk(*) behind the parameter
to receive many variables.It is non keyword arguments.
example:
def func(*friuts):
    for fruit in friuts:   
     print(fruit) 

fruits=func("apple","banana","orange","jackfruit")

**kwargs: **kwargs is used to send data to function's parameter as a variable.It is also
called keyword arguments because it works with key value pair.It is used double asterisk(**).
To return many value,**kwargs is also used.Here,parameter sequence does not carry any problem.

example:

def full_name(first,last):
    name=f'full name is : {first} {last}'
    return name
name=full_name(last='dwip',first='shawmitra')
print(name)
